# Protovue Examples
- [Simple Flowchart](https://codesandbox.io/s/4lrrk0jj9) - Lo-fi prototype of a flowchart turned into an app.
- [Yellow Layout](https://codesandbox.io/s/pkjmw9vvvm) - A slightly more complicated layout.
- [Intro Element](https://codesandbox.io/s/2v316prv8p?hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.vue&view=preview) - Sometimes it's a good idea to give users a bit of context before you show a prototype.
- [Wireframe Layout](https://codesandbox.io/s/4zz1x0qxp9) - Shows a layout using a thin line to divide sections instead of the default boxes with rounded corners.
- [Signup Form](https://codesandbox.io/s/6j324y319n) - Shows how multiple `<v1-grid>` elements can be used as screens in a simple workflow.
- [Protovue Template](https://codesandbox.io/s/ry7z3x808q) - Simple CodeSandbox project showing how to install Protovue and use a `<v1-grid>` element with `guides`.
